New memory bus mapping systems for both CPU and PPU

CpuMemoryBus

 |-- Mapper

 |--------------- PPU registers
 |--------------- APU registers

 |-- CpuMemory

Master memory manager with read8/16 and write functions
Should be as generic as possible for CPU and PPU if we can
Mapper informs it where it maps to in this range, if hit call that
CPU should also be bound to call PPU and APU registers
 \- These call the PPU/APU read/write functions, not directly mapping!
    They're memory-mapped registers on the system, not in CPU or RAM.
Finally call CPU for memory
If the range isn't instanced, return a 3-bit open bus with offset set to pos
 \- This way we can be at position 1 and write 2 bytes safely
